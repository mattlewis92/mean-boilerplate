Nasty
================

## About
Nasty is a set of MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular and Node.js) boilerplate code ideal for starting a new project. 

It is probably far too opinionated for most people and there isn't any accompanying documentation or tests (yet).

Oh and in case you were wondering about the name, it's a synonym for mean.


## Yeoman generators
There is a set of yeoman generators that you can use for scaffolding the app and new components you might build as you go along. 

You can find more info about the generators here: https://github.com/mattlewis92/generator-nasty
